# Progenitor

Progenitor is a light-weight installation profile that provides a basic starting
place for Phase2 projects. This is *not a product*, but rather a toolkit and
showcase. You can read more on the wiki at [Code Reuse](https://wiki.phase2technology.com/display/Deliver/Code+Reuse).

## Usage

There are several ways to use Progenitor in a project.

* Use Progenitor as your base profile to facilitate contribution back.
* Fork the Progenitor to your project's namespace to use it as a starting place.
* Include as a git submodule and include in your makefile: `includes[progenitor] = progenitor/build-progenitor.make`

## Todos

* Restructure repository for grunt-based build & tooling.
