# Progenitor

Progenitor is a light-weight installation profile that provides a basic starting
place for Phase2 projects. The intention is for it to serve as a sane, standardized
default.

## Usage

There are several ways to use Progenitor in a project.

* Use Progenitor as your base profile to facilitate contribution back.
* Fork the Progenitor to your project's namespace to use it as a starting place.

## Todos

* Restructure repository for grunt-based build & tooling.
